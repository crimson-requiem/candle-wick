Converts game controller inputs into mouse and keyboard inputs. My first Python project on Github!
**Platforms:**
<br>
Windows: Works completely fine.
<br>
Linux: Requires Wine or another .exe runner, but should work also fine.
<br>
macOS: Probably won't work. Sorry. :(
# Controls
The controls work as follows:
<br>
Left Joystick: Cursor movement
D-Pad: More precise, but slower cursor movement.
Right Joystick: Scrolling
Y: Opens Virtual Keyboard on Windows.
X: Page Up.
A: Page Down.
B: Switches tabs.
Select/Minus: Backspace.
Start/Plus: Enter.
