Converts game controller inputs into mouse and keyboard inputs. My first Python project on Github!
<br>
**Platforms:**
<br>
Windows: Works completely fine.
<br>
Linux: Requires Wine or another .exe runner, but should work also fine.
<br>
macOS: Probably won't work. Sorry. :(
# Instructions
Run the executable. Do not close it. It will be an empty command window, and that's because it has no GUI or anything similar. If your controllers disconnect, it _will_ close.
<br>
If followed, this should work smoothly.
# Controls
The controls work as follows:
<br>
- Left Joystick: Cursor movement
- D-Pad: More precise, but slower cursor movement.
- Right Joystick: Scrolling
- Y: Opens Virtual Keyboard on Windows.
- X: Toggles right mouse button. Press X again to release it.
- A: Toggles left mouse button. Press A again to release it.
- B: Switches tabs.
- Select/Minus: Backspace.
- Start/Plus: Enter.
- Left Bumper: Scroll Up
- Right Bumper: Scroll Down
- Left Trigger: Right click
- Right trigger: Left click
- L3: Open a new tab.
- R3: Click the mouse wheel.
